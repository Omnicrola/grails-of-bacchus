    "description": "From the 12 apexes of the Aether, the Craftsmen took the essences of the Aethers and concentrated them. Taking the solid concentrations of power, they then sealed with debaucherous magiks, locking thier power forever into the drinking vessel. It is said that when this Grail is brought into the focus point near the intersections of Ley lines, the Grail will glow with an unearthly light which is certainly healthy and safe."
